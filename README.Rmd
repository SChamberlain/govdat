## Description

`rsunlight` is a collection of functions to search and acquire data from the various Sunlight Labs APIs for government data, at [http://sunlightfoundation.com/api/](http://sunlightfoundation.com/api/).

`rsunlight` wraps functions in APIs for:

* Congress API (`cg`)
* Open States API (`os`)
* Capitol Words API (`cw`)
* Influence Explorer API (`ie`)

Functions that wrap these sets of APIs will be prefixed by `cg`, `os`, `cw`, or `ie` for the different methods listed above:

* `cg` + `fxn`
* `os` + `fxn`
* `cw` + `fxn`
* `ie` + `fxn`

where `fxn` would be a function to a interface with a specific Sunlight Foundation API.

Please get your own API keys if you plant to use these functions for Sunlight Labs (http://sunlightfoundation.com/api/).

Data from the Sunlight Foundation API is provided by Sunlight Foundation.

<a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/api/"><img src="http://www.altweeklies.com/imager/b/main/5866471/f291/SunlightFoundationLogo_500wide.gif" alt="NYT API" /></a>

We set up the functions so that you can put the key in your .Rprofile file, which will be called on startup of R, and then you don't have to enter your API key for each run of a function. For example, put this in your `.Rprofile` file:

```
# key for API access to the Sunlight Labs API methods
options(SunlightLabsKey = "YOURKEYHERE")
```

**Note** that Puerto Rico is not included in Sunlight Foundation data.

If you store your key in your `.Rprofile` file it will be read inside of each function call. Or you can pass your key into each function call manually by `key=yourkey`.

## Install rsunlight

From CRAN

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rsunlight")
```

Or development version from Github

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("ropengov/rsunlight")
```

```{r}
library("rsunlight")
```

## Get districts for a latitude/longitude.

```{r}
cg_districts(latitude = 35.778788, longitude = -78.787805)
```

## Search congress people and senate members.

```{r}
out <- cg_legislators(last_name = 'Reed')
```

## Find the popularity of a phrase over a period of time.

Get a list of how many times the phrase "united states" appears in the Congressional Record in each month between January and June, 2010:

```{r}
cw_timeseries(phrase='united states', start_date='2009-01-01', end_date='2009-04-30', granularity='month')
```

```{r tidy=FALSE}
library("ggplot2")
dat_d <- cw_timeseries(phrase='climate change', party="D")
dat_d$party <- rep("D", nrow(dat_d))
dat_r <- cw_timeseries(phrase='climate change', party="R")
dat_r$party <- rep("R", nrow(dat_r))
dat_both <- rbind(dat_d, dat_r)
ggplot(dat_both, aes(day, count, colour=party)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_grey(base_size=20) +
  scale_colour_manual(values=c("blue","red"))
```

## Interactive charts using rCharts

Note that the resulting chart opens in a browser, so is not shown in this vignette, but you will see it open in a browser when you run the code.

```{r eval=FALSE}
dream <- lapply(c('D','R'), function(x) cw_timeseries(phrase = 'i have a dream', party = x, start_date = '1996-01-01', end_date = '2013-01-01', granularity = 'month'))
df <- merge(dream[[1]], dream[[2]], by = 'month', all = TRUE)
df[is.na(df)] <- 0
names(df) <- c('date','D','R')
df$date <- as.character(df$date)
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(rCharts)
m1 <- mPlot(x = "date", y = c("D", "R"), type = "Line", data = df)
m1$set(pointSize = 0, lineWidth = 1)
m1
```

_note: as you can see this is not actually interactive, but when you make it, it will be_

## Return the top contributing organizations

Ranked by total dollars given. An organization's giving is broken down into money given directly (by the organization's PAC) versus money given by individuals employed by or associated with the organization.

```{r}
ie_industries(method = 'top_ind', limit = 4)
```
