R CMD CHECK passed on my local OS X install on R 3.2.1 and R Under development, Ubuntu running on Travis-CI, and Win builder.

This submission is by request from CRAN maintainers to make sure any dependencies in this package are in mainstream repositories. I had one package that did not comply, rCharts, and it is no longer used in this package. 

Thanks! Scott Chamberlain
